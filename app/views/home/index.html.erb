          <h2>Ever try to hire a web design agency?</h2>
          <p>I have. It sucks.
          <br>
          Picking from the plethora of options out there and the overly bloated service agencies is almost impossible. It is getting harder and harder to find a group of guys who just make really good websites.
          <br>
          Anytime I get a proposal from a service agency, I always find myself flipping to the last page to see how much it’ll cost and how long it will take. The overly “salesy” tactics are getting old. Almost everything we are presented with does not relate to us and leave us with less confidence and more decision fatigue. Worse yet, imagine if you get a surprise bill at the end of the cycle with things you never knew you asked for.</p>

          <h2>But, hey, at least you can do it yourself right?</h2>
          <p>Yes, you definitely can. But which platform are you going to choose? Wordpress? Squarespace? Wix? Webflow? GoDaddy? HubSpot? Weebly? Shopify? Duda? Strinkingly? You get the point. Good luck trying to weigh your options and making a decision there.
          <br>
          And let’s say you do make a decision. Then your website will look like every other generic template out there with no soul but a super futuristic look that feels like it could be an ad for SpaceX.</p>

          <h2>Here is the truth.</h2>
          <p>Getting on the web shouldn’t be complicated.
          <br>
          Web design agencies have become bloated with big offices and too many employees.
          <br>
          Nobody has access to “propriety” tools that are hidden from everybody else.
          <br>
          Creative work cannot be outsourced to AI or a cheap agency in India or China.</p>

          <h2>This is why I started Hampton Lab.</h2>
          <p>I started Hampton Lab because I love simplicity. You should know what you’re getting, when you’re getting it, and what you’re paying for it. Services should be at a fixed price and you should pay one time for your website. No fuss.
          <br>
          We are really good at we do and we think our work will speak for itself.</p>
