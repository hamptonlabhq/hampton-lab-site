            So I started <strong>Hampton Lab</strong>.
            <br>
            We build websites. Nothing more, nothing less. You'll know the price upfront. You'll know when it's done. You'll know exactly what you're getting.
            <br>
            We work with people who value craft over complications. If that's you, let's talk.
